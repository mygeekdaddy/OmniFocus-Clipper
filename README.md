OmniFocus-Clipper
=================

Description: Text clipper for OmniFocus on iOS using Pythonista &amp; javascript bookmarklet.

Detail: The goal for the clipper is to take copied text from a web page and clip the text, page title, and URL into a new task for OmniFocus. In the process of adding the task into OmniFocus, Pythonista will ask for a task description and then concatenate the copied text, page title and page URL into a single text block that will be added as a note to the newly created task.

There are two parts to the text clipper: Pythonista script and a javascript bookmarklet. The name of the script is not critical, but keeping the name of the script saved in Pythonista and the referenced script in the javascript bookmarklet need to be the same.
